HTML and CSS splitting screeens


I have a divs sitting inside of a section tag 
<section class="test-pane1 col-xs-12">
        <div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 content-side"></div>
        </div>
</section>
The section has a background image that roles over, each section has a different background image. They role over each other 
once bigger browser larger than 768px;

My issue is because it sits in a section tag I end up with a gap arond the divs.
Any suggestions how I can remove this?
